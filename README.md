# Golf-Statistics-Module-2

## Introduction

For this project, I analyzed data and metrics regarding PGA golfers. I reviewed data for 1678 golfers (over 9 seasons) in order to determine which stats and metrics play the biggest role in determining a PGA golfers' earnings per Tournament. In order to get the data collection of PGA golfers to review, I downloaded a dataset from Kaggle that was webscraped from PGA.com and uploaded by Brad Klassen. I created data visualizations through MatPlotLib, Seaborn and Pandas in order to analyze the data. For further analysis, I used Statsmodels to create multiple linear regression models. 

## Objectives

Using the data that I collected, I wanted to answer the following questions:
* What does a distribution of golfers' earnings per tournament look like at a 95% confidence interval?
* Which golfers make the most and least amount of money per tournament?
* Does driving distance affect a golfers' earnings per tournament?
* Does driving accuracy affect a golfers' earnings per tournament?
* Does percentage of Greens in Regulation affect a golfers' earnings per tournament?
* Does the average number of putts per round affect a golfers' earnings per tournament?
* Can one make an accurate multiple linear regression model using golf stats and metrics to predict earnings per tournament?
